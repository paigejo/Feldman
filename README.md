Feldman
=======

Contains research with Dr. Daniel Feldman at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.  There are two projects in this folder. One is a program that reformats Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate data (from multiple formats to a single, unified format).  The other uses Princple Component Analysis (PCA) to study simulated remote sensing spectral data from MODTRAN.
